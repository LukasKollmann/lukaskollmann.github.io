#“Learning to put what you love in the moment, on your body forever.”

In mid 2014 "Kunststätte" tattoo studio contacted me that they reopened their shop in the middle of Klagenfurt city. For that purpose they needed an image movie and a new website to represent their new pretty studio.

Together with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/raphael.koitz?fref=ts">Raphael Koitz</a> we filmed the clip to show the perfect location of the studio, as well as the beautiful people, premises, clothes and tattoos.

 We also designed and set up a WordPress-Site, so that the client has full control over the published content. Our design approach was to make a clean and modern website, where the image movie and the pictures stand out and speak a strong visual language.

You can have a full look at the website here at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kunststaette.com">kunststaette.com</a>.
