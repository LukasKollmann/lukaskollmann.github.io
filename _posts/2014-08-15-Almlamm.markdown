#Modern touch for a traditional business

In mid 2014 I created a Logo and business cards for the family business "Almlamm", based in Carinthia, Austria.
The lamb comes from a small agriculture on the "Saualm", where no chemicals and no production-enhancing agents are used. The meat is produced among an animal welfare and a sustainable economy. 

I designed a Logo which is modern and fresh, but doesn't forget the traditional roots of the family business.
