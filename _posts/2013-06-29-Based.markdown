#European alternative to American Apparel

During 3rd semester at FH Joanneum we faced the challenge to develop an European based fashion label that should be a an alternative to the fashion label American Apparel. We had to build a business model, design the whole brand and find an USP to stand out.

Our label,named BASED, features high quality basics and has the whole production process done in Europe, so we can roll out collections faster, produce unique clothing with a european touch and ensure the best quality for our customers.

The Corporate Identity was developed by <a target="_blank" href="http://stefanreinprecht.at">Stefan Reinprecht</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://cargocollective.com/mariechristin">Marie Christin Url</a> and myself and is a clean, simple and timeless approach which are the key values of BASED. We combine minimalistic typography with strong and humorous images as well as modern graphic design.
