#Coworking space in the heart of Graz
While working at Wundertüte, our virtual company at FH Joanneum (BA), the founder of Sechserhaus,Heimo Lercher, comissioned us with the project to design and developd a website for his company.

Our main and exact task was to build a full featured WordPress-website for the creative coworking-space Sechserhaus in Graz, which offers various premises und services for working together with others in a creative environment.

We created an information architecture and an visual inventory of elements that we wanted to integrate into the site. After a few iteration rounds and meetings with the client the development team started to built an HTML prototype to optimize the site for mobile devices. Stefan Reinprecht, Thomas Mirnig and Felix Pichler did a great job by making the site totally dynamic via WordPress, integrating a flexible floor plan as well as making the site fully responsive.

You can have a full look at the website here at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sechserhaus.net">sechserhaus.net</a>.
