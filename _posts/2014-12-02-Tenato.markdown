# Workflow Yourself
In mid 2013 I were asked to join a small start-up company from Graz, which was called Teamghost at that time, to do their design related work. They told me, that they'd developed a Webapp that helps creating schedules for companies or workteams. 

Pretty fast, I realised that this project had potential, but I wasn't able to do the whole work on my own. So I decided to join forces with one of my best buddies, <a target="_blank" href="http://stefanreinprecht.at">Stefan Reinprecht</a>, who is an excellent allrounder and an enrichment for every team or job.

Our first job was to find a new name that fits the product, concept and the could represent the company as well. After a lot of different suggestions we came up with „tenato“, which stands for team-navigation-tool.

Since then, we faced a bunch of different tasks, problems and design iterations. Below you can see a few preview images of the Logo, Web- and Mobile-app. We hope to roll out tenato as soon as possible. Stay tuned for more images and information!
