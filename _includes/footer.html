      <p><b>Hy!</b> My name is Lukas Kollmann and I'm a freelance designer based in Graz, Austria. The most entertaining thing for me is to create content that works properly and looks appealing. At the moment, I really enjoy motion design and cinematography, as well as web- and app design. If needed, I can also handle branding- and illustration tasks, plus, I have some basic knowledge in front end development. When there's time left, I like to produce some crappy hip-hop music, jump around with my snowboard or play all kind of video games.</p> <p>What I like most about my job is, that you learn so much about different fields and what people are doing. That includes, that you always have to be up to date and know what's going on in the world to be one step ahead and deliver decent work. So whats drives me? Gain knowledge and experience, boost my skillset, meet cool people, make it to America and make a living from design.</p> <p>Feel free to hook me up 24/7 or stalk me on social media.</p>
